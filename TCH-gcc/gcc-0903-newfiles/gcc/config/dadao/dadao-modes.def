/* Like other non-CC0 ports, DADAO need to code which combination of
   comparison insn and branch insn or conditional-set insn to use into the
   condition mode.  The CC mode depends partly on which condition is used
   and partly on the type of the operands.  */

/* The "usual" CC mode is used for a signed operands integer comparison,
   where the CMP insn is used and the result is (integer) -1, 0 or 1 for
   respectively a < b, a == b and a > b.  */

/* The CCUU mode is for an unsigned operands integer comparison using
   the CMPU insn.  Result values correspond to those in CCmode.  */

/* The CCFF mode is for a floating-point comparison using FTC/FOC insn.
   The result is 1 for true, 0 for false, otherwise -1. */
